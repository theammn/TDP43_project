# RNA-Binding Motifs in Human TDP43 and Its Interactors

This project aims to identify RNA-binding motifs in the human TDP43 protein and compare these motifs to those found in proteins that interact with TDP43. By analyzing the conservation of these motifs across different interactors, we can gain insights into their functional significance in RNA-protein interactions.

# Goals:
1. Identify RNA-binding motifs in the human TDP43 protein.
2. Analyze the conservation of these motifs in the interactors of TDP43.
3. Compare conservation scores to understand how well these motifs are preserved across different interacting proteins.
4. Identify commonly conserved motifs that are shared between human TDP43 and its interactors.

As input, we will have msas files from TDP43 and few targeted interactors.
We try now to identify RNA-Binding Motifs and search for these motifs in the sequences of human TDP43 and its interactors, in order to then calculate conservation scores
